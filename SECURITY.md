## iw4x-client Security
We take security very seriously at XLabsProject. We welcome any peer review of our 100% free software source code to ensure nobody's IW4x clients or servers are ever compromised or hacked.

### Where should I report security issues?

In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues privately.
Please e-mail MauriceHeumann@gmail.com directly to provide details and repro steps.

### Other key people

In the exceptional case that you do not receive a response within a reasonable time frame from our lead developer, please contact any of the following people:
- Future/diamante0018: iw4x-sp@proton.me

We will try respond as soon as possible, but please note:

### This is an entirely free software project. It is maintained in our spare time.
### We cannot guarantee quick responses but we very much appreciate your discretion when reporting security vulnerabilities.
